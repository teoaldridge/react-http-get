# react-http-get
An exercise project, in which i learned how to connect a react project to a database and send a GET request 

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller
https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

In this exercise, I learned and practiced: 
- How to send a GET Request
- Using async/await
- Handling Loading & Data States
- Handling http Errors
- Using useEffect() for Requests


To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74827533/170994223-32d81f14-6be1-42af-8c99-1d30f8adb46b.png)
